This library aim to emulate the whatsapp web interface in order to create
an usable gateway to whatsapp.

**Please note that this work is far from complete**: it's not an usable library, it's just a research work.

Please note that **bots and gateways** are not allowed by WhatsApp policy.

This code is only for learning/research.

Remember to set environment with `env.sh` script.

See PROTOCOL.md for details
